# ::musings

::musing is a custom front-end for hosting and presenting content from a WordPress blog. Build with Vue.js, it is utilizes the WordPress REST API to fetch and display content.

The goal of this project is to fine-tune the user experience and customize the presentation of content hosted on my WordPress blog. By building a custom front-end, I have more control over the design and functionality, allowing a tailored experience for readers.

This project is a work in progress with known bugs and missing functionality.

## To implement
- Media lightbox
- Category filters
